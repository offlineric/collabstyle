collabstyle
===========

__cool, so what is this?__

this is an attempt at creating a *super sexy* 4chan userstyle with [@saxamaphone69](https://github.com/saxamaphone69)! 
Make sure you check out his [work](https://github.com/saxamaphone69/collabstyle) it's way cooler and better than this mess.


__things you will need to test this half in its current state__
* you will need [this](https://github.com/offlineric/4chan-x/raw/master/builds/4chan-X.user.js) version of seaweed's 4chan x with approximately 2 whole lines added to it, to accomdate styling the removal of items from the document. i will try to keep it up to date. 
* if you want to see exactly what I've done, you can check the changelog [here](https://github.com/offlineric/4chan-x/commit/ce045fd2642d7c758fd6e99d1ca8ac1783c6a219) you can click show diff or whatever to see the lines if you'd rather change them yourself
* along with the [userscript](https://github.com/offlineric/collabstyle/raw/master/scrolling_class.user.js) (or the [testing](https://github.com/offlineric/collabstyle/raw/master/testing.user.js) version if you prefer) in this repo, and the [stylesheet](https://github.com/offlineric/collabstyle/raw/master/collabstyle.css) (or [testing](https://github.com/offlineric/collabstyle/raw/master/testing.css) again). None of this is really optional in its current interdependent state.
* and the font lol.ttf if you want working symbol things because i used that in the css. 
* you should probably have droid sans as well.

enjoy your animated 4chan

p.p.s. be sure to check out what Johnny is up to for some more next level shit. none of this happens without him
p.p.p.s. if you can't figure out how to put the settings for 4chan-x (important ones are persistant qr, no thread watcher, and some other stuff that i forget) you can use my [exported](https://raw.github.com/offlineric/collabstyle/master/settings.json) settings to save some time. warning: this will have some filters and stuff that you may not want.

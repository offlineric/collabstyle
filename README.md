^ you will need this version of seaweed's 4chan x with approximately 2 whole lines added to it. i will try to keep it up to date. 

if you want to see exactly what I've done, you can check here
https://github.com/offlineric/4chan-x/commit/ce045fd2642d7c758fd6e99d1ca8ac1783c6a219

along with the userscript in this repo, and the stylesheet. 
and the font lol.ttf if you want working symbol things because i used that in the css. 
you should probably have droid sans as well

enjoy your animated 4chan

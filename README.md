collabstyle
===========

__cool, so what is this?__

this is an attempt at creating a *super sexy* 4chan userstyle with [@saxamaphone69](https://github.com/saxamaphone69)!


__things you will need to test this half in its current state__
* you will need [this](https://github.com/offlineric/4chan-x/raw/master/builds/4chan-X.user.js) version of seaweed's 4chan x with approximately 2 whole lines added to it, to accomdate styling the removal of items from the document. i will try to keep it up to date. 
* if you want to see exactly what I've done, you can check the changelog [here](https://github.com/offlineric/4chan-x/commit/ce045fd2642d7c758fd6e99d1ca8ac1783c6a219) you can click show diff or whatever to see the lines if you'd rather change them yourself
* along with the [userscript](https://github.com/offlineric/collabstyle/raw/master/scrolling_class.user.js) in this repo, and the [stylesheet](https://github.com/offlineric/collabstyle/raw/master/collabstyle.css). None of this is really optional in its current interdependent state.
* and the font lol.ttf if you want working symbol things because i used that in the css. 
* you should probably have droid sans as well.

enjoy your animated 4chan
